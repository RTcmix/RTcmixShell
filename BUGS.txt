--------------------
LIMITATIONS

- "include" feature of MinC does not work
- the DisplayWindow and MouseWindow programs do not work
- rtoutput doesn't work; use RTcmixShell Record feature instead
- libdnafuncs (open_dnafile, get_aminoacid, etc.) doesn't work
- some instruments missing: GRANULATE, NPAN, QPAN, RESYNTH, SROOM,
  DUMP, LPCPLAY, MMOVE, MOVE, vccm stuff (see WIN_EXCLUDES.txt
  in wRTcmixlib src)
- no Python or Perl front end
- no netplay capability
- no dso loading; instruments are all compiled in to one monolithic
  binary. So no need to use the load function to pull them in.
