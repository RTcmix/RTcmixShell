--------------------
LIMITATIONS

- the DisplayWindow and MouseWindow programs do not work
- rtoutput doesn't work; use RTcmixShell Record feature instead
- libdnafuncs (open_dnafile, get_aminoacid, etc.) doesn't work
- some instruments missing: RESYNTH, SROOM,
  DUMP, LPCPLAY, MMOVE, MOVE, vccm stuff (see WIN_EXCLUDES.txt
  in wRTcmixlib src)
- no Python or Perl front end
- no netplay capability
- no dso loading; instruments are all compiled in to one monolithic
  binary. So no need to use the load function to pull them in.

BUGS

- When you choose an audio interface for the input that has only
  one channel (typically a microphone), that constrains the number
  of channels for the output as well. This is an RTcmix issue
  that's exacerbated by design here. The input and output channel
  counts should be decoupled everywhere. For the moment, we don't
  even take live input in RTcmixShell.
- On Windows, it's really bad not to have a higher level audio
  driver selection menu, because then all the lower-level elements
  are given in a flat list that is hard to understand. On macOS
  this driver menu normally would have just CoreAudio in it.
  See how Max handles this.
- Sometimes when I'm running a score, the stop button isn't enabled.
  This is in exclusive, not overlapping, score mode.
