v1.0b4 (8/xx/17)
	- Fix bug: after turning line numbers off, the area that used to be
	  underneath the line number strip would not show the text edit cursor
	  or let you select text.
	- Fix bug: edit score, drag new file in from Finder => replaces dirty
	  score without giving user a chance to save.

v1.0b3 (8/22/17)
	- Complete implementation of prefs dialog.
	- Optionally show line numbers in left margin of editor.
	- Added a clipping indicator in the toolbar.
	- Now has an app icon.
	- Can now drag a .sco icon onto the app icon to launch the app with
	  the score, or drag the .sco icon onto the app icon in the Dock while
	  it's running. (Not such a big deal, since you can already drag a .sco
	  into the edit window to open it.)
	- Expanded credits in About box.
	- Current working directory set to the one containing the most recently
	  opened score, so that relative rtinput paths can work.
	- Use the first available audio output device if the one stored in the
	  preferences file is no longer attached to the system.
	- If score has fatal syntax errors recognized by RTcmix, don't try to
	  play it.

v1.0b2 (8/12/17)
	- Can now save score files.
	- Save dialog initially points to the user's home directory, instead of
	  to the app binary's directory.
	- Stop button destroys RTcmix and recreates it each time, instead of just
	  flushing the heap.
	- Log view at bottom of window.
	- Play/Stop buttons now pushbuttons, offering more definite feedback.
	  Leaving the text labels in them for now.
	- Play/Stop buttons now mutually exclusive. Stop is invoked automatically
	  when score has finished playing.
	- Option to allow overlapping, rather than exclusive, scores.
	- Record button starts score and records to a sound file.
	- Drag a text file or .sco into the editor to open it; drag a wav or aiff
	  file, or a folder, into the editor to drop its full path at the insertion
	  point, surrounded by double-quotes.
	- Print in gray the RTcmix commands that are invalid in this environment:
	  rtsetparams, load, rtoutput (though rtoutput causes a crash).
	- Uses a settings file to store state. The Preferences dialog for changing
	  some of these settings is partially implemented.

v1.0b1 (8/1/17)
	- Initial test version
